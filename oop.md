# OOP

### Basic Concepts of OOPs?
The Basic Concepts of OOP is ecapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism.

### What is a class?
Сlass is a data structure that contains data fields, like a record, as well as various methods which operate on the contents of the record.

### What is an object?
Is instance of a class

### What is Encapsulation?
It’s mechanism for restricting direct access to some of the object's components

### What roles perform inheritance?
inheritance is when an object or class is based on another object (prototypal inheritance) or class (class-based inheritance), using the same implementation.

### Different between method overriding and method overloading?
Overloading occurs when two or more methods in one class have the same method name but different parameters. Overriding means having two methods with the same method name and parameters (i.e., method signature). One of the methods is in the parent class and the other is in the child class.

### What are the mechanisms in OOP languages that usually allow provide encapsulation of objects?
Using Private, public, protected keywords.

### Describe S.O.L.I.D?
These five principles were called the S.O.L.I.D principles (the acronym was derived by Michael Feathers).

S: Single Responsibility Principle
O: Open-Closed Principle
L: Liskov Substitution Principle
I: Interface Segregation Principle
D: Dependency Inversion Principle
S: A class should be responsible for only one thing. If a class has more than one responsibility, it becomes coupled. A change to one responsibility results to modification of the other responsibility.

O: Every animal adds its own implementation on how it makes a sound in the makeSound. The AnimalSound iterates through the array of animal and just calls its makeSound method.

L: The aim of this principle is to ascertain that a sub-class can assume the place of its super-class without errors. If the code finds itself checking the type of class then, it must have violated this principle.

I: This principle deals with the disadvantages of implementing big interfaces.

D: There comes a point in software development where our app will be largely composed of modules. When this happens, we have to clear things up by using dependency injection. High-level components depending on low-level components to function.
