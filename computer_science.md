### How work bubble sort.
The idea is pretty simple: Walk through the list and put two adjacent elements in descending order. But, hereâ€™s the kicker: We have to repeatedly walk through the list until there are no longer any swaps to make, meaning, the list is sorter.
```
def bubble_sort(array)
  n = array.length
  loop do
    swapped = false

    (n-1).times do |i|
      if array[i] > array[i+1]
        array[i], array[i+1] = array[i+1], array[i]
        swapped = true
      end
    end

    break if not swapped
  end

  array
end
```
