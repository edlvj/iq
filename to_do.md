What Is Idempotence?

Idempotence is a funky word that often hooks people. Idempotence is sometimes a confusing concept, at least from the academic definition.

From a RESTful service standpoint, for an operation (or service call) to be idempotent, clients can make that same call repeatedly while producing the same result. In other words, making multiple identical requests has the same effect as making a single request. Note that while idempotent operations produce the same result on the server (no side effects), the response itself may not be the same (e.g. a resource's state may change between requests).
