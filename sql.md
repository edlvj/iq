# SQL


### What does 2 <> NULL return? The type of a NULL value in SQL has a slightly different meaning than in applied programming languages. If in C-like languages, NULL means the absence of some value, then in SQL it means only that we don’t know this value. For this reason, any comparison with NULL returns false.What does 3 NOT IN (1, 2, NULL) return? 

As we know from the previous example, 3 <> NULL returns false, and therefore the entire condition (3 <> 1) AND (3 <> 2) AND (3 <> NULL) will also be false.

### Will this query execute? 
```
SELECT 
	order_id,
	order_code,
	SUM(order_value)
FROM 
	orders
GROUP BY
	order_id
```	
It all depends on the database. If this query is executed in MySQL, the order_code column will be added to the GROUP BY clause automatically and the query will execute fine. If this query is executed by MS SQL Server, then an error will be generated by default.

###  Why will this request not execute? 
```
SELECT 
	user_name,
	YEAR(user_birth_date) AS year_of_birth
FROM 
	users
WHERE
	year_of_birth = 2000
```	
Expressions that are responsible for getting data, such as WHERE, need to use the original field names.

### Does column order in a composite index matter? 
Yes. The columns in the search should be placed first in the composite index.

### What is the difference between TRUNCATE TABLE table_name and DELETE FROM table_name?  

Both of these commands will cause the removal of rows from a table called table_name, but this will happen in very different ways.

### What is the difference between the types CHAR and VARCHAR? 
CHAR is suitable for storing fixed-length string data and VARCHAR or NVARCHAR are more suitable for other lines.

### What is the difference between the types VARCHAR and NVARCHAR? In the VARCHAR format, you should store string data that you don’t need to transfer (for example, email addresses). 
For other cases, you can use NVARCHAR.

### What is the difference between UNION and UNION ALL?  
The difference between them is that if the query contains the same lines, the UNION will remove duplicates, leaving only one of these lines.

### What is the difference between WHERE and HAVING expressions? 
WHERE can work independently and filter the data of each row of the result separately, and HAVING expression works only in combination with the GROUP BY expression and filters the already grouped values.

### How primary key differs from foreign one?
In SQL Server, there are two keys - primary key and foreign key which seems identical, but actually both are different in features and behaviours.

Primary Key
- Primary key uniquely identify a record in the table.
- Primary Key can't accept null values.
- By default, Primary key is clustered index and data in the database table is physically organized in the sequence of clustered index.
- We can have only one Primary key in a table.

Foreign Key
- Foreign key is a field in the table that is primary key in another table.
- Foreign key can accept multiple null value.
- Foreign key do not automatically create an index, clustered or non-clustered. You can manually create an index on foreign key.
- We can have more than one foreign key in a table.

Defining Primary key
```
CREATE TABLE Department 
 (
 DeptID int PRIMARY KEY, --define primary key
 Name varchar (50) NOT NULL,
 Address varchar(100) NULL 
)
```

Defining Foreign key

```
CREATE TABLE Employee 
 (
 EmpID int PRIMARY KEY, --define primary key
 Name varchar (50) NOT NULL,
 Salary int NULL,
 --define foreign key
 DeptID int FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Department(DeptID)
 ) 

```

### What is Transaction in SQL?

A transaction is a logical unit of work that contains one or more SQL statements. A transaction is an atomic unit. The effects of all the SQL statements in a transaction can be either all committed (applied to the database) or all rolled back (undone from the database).

### Describe difference between LEFT JOIN от INNER JOIN?
INNER JOIN: returns rows when there is a match in both tables.

LEFT JOIN: returns all rows from the left table, even if there are no matches in the right table.
