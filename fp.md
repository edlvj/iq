# FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING

### What is Pure Functions?

Methods with no side effects(mutations of objects) are called pure functions. The evaluation of a pure function results in a value determined solely by its arguments and has no observable side
effects.

Referential transparency is
achieved if the expression can be replaced by the value of the expression without
changing the programâ€™s behavior. 

### What is Higher order function?
